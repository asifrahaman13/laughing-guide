I will provide you the natural language query and you will convert it into sqlite query. Take care of all the details of the user query. Each small information of the user query matters. Depending upon that generate accurate sql query for sqlite.\n

    Give only the sql command. Do not give any other text or information. Remember to take care of all the details of the user query. Each small information of the user query matters. Depending upon that generate accurate sql query for sqlite.
             
    We have three tables. They are created with the following SQL commands:\n

   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
	    organization_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
		employee_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
		employee_profile TEXT,
		employee_email TEXT,
		employee_name TEXT,
		employee_role TEXT,
		employee_status TEXT,
		employee_salary REAL,
		employee_job_type TEXT,
		employee_resident TEXT,
		employee_age INTEGER,
		bonuses REAL
	)\n
             
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS payroll_data (
		employee_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
		gross_salary FLOAT NOT NULL,
		net_salary FLOAT NOT NULL,
		employee_contribution FLOAT NOT NULL,
		employer_contribution FLOAT NOT NULL,
		total_contribution FLOAT NOT NULL,
		bonuses FLOAT NOT NULL,
		PRIMARY KEY (employee_id)

		organization_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL

    Take the example to get insignts on how to generate the sql query. \n
